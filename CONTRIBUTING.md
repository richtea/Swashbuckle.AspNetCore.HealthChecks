# Contributing to this Repository

Thanks for considering a contribution to this repo! Your help and feedback is really appreciated.

You can contribute in a number of ways:

- Reporting bugs

- Suggesting enhancements

- Making code contributions

## Reporting bugs

If something isn't working how you expect it to, it might be a bug in the code. Please create an issue to let us know,
and tag it with the https://github.com/richtea/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.HealthChecks/labels/type%3A%20bug tag.

When filing a bug, please explain:

- What behaviour you observed and what you expected to observe.

- Steps to reproduce the error, if possible (or a link to the workflow where the problematic
  behavior can be observed).

## Proposing enhancements

If you have a good idea for something that you'd like to see,  we'd love to hear about it. Please
create an issue and tag it:

- Use the https://github.com/richtea/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.HealthChecks/labels/type%3A%20feature tag if it's a new
  feature.

- Use the https://github.com/richtea/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.HealthChecks/labels/type%3A%20docs tag if it relates to the
  docs.

## Code contributions

Code contributions are welcome, following the [standard GitHub
process](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects). If the changes
are non-trivial, you are advised to propose the enhancement first by creating an issue, so that the
proposal can be discussed before you spend lots of time working on it.

Style checks and other analyzers are built-in. Please keep your style consistent with existing code and fix all warnings
before you create a PR.

Instructions for the release process are [here](./docs/ReleaseProcess.md).
